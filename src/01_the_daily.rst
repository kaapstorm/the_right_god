Michael Barbaro
    From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.
    Today, a story that may change our perspective on God, the
    fundamental nature of the universe, and our role in it. We're
    joined by Ruth Graham, a Dallas-based national correspondent who
    covers religion, faith and values for The New York Times. Ruth,
    welcome to The Daily.

Ruth Graham
    Thank you, Michael. It's great to be here.

Michael Barbaro
    So, Ruth, where does this story begin?

Ruth Graham
    It begins with a late-night discussion among friends about
    religion.

Michael Barbaro
    I have had discussions like that one. Did it end well?

Ruth Graham (laughs)
    They don't always, do they? This one ended with a challenge,
    Michael. A friend of mine jokingly suggested that we could look at
    COVID statistics to determine which society believes in the right
    god. If there was a population out there praying to the right god,
    surely they would have had the lowest death rate. The challenge was
    to find out if such a population exists.

Michael Barbaro
    That sounds quite intriguing. I would imaging that COVID statistics
    can get messy. What did you find?

Ruth Graham
    Well, Michael, you are right, COVID statistics do get messy. They
    are hampered by difficulties with reporting, they are manipulated
    by politicians, and they are complicated by comorbidities. But
    there is a way to get a bird's-eye view on death statistics. You
    can just wait a year or two, and then compare total deaths for
    COVID years with the years before and after.

Michael Barbaro
    That makes sense. What did you discover?

Ruth Graham
    To be honest, I did not expect to discover anything. But to my
    astonishment I found a community who lives on an island in the
    north of Sri Lanka. Health data on this community appeared to be
    missing, but it turned out that it's not missing. This community is
    just extraordinarily healthy. They don't live significantly longer
    than other people. They just seldom get sick. Very seldom.

Michael Barbaro
    How seldom?

Ruth Graham
    Suspiciously seldom. There is no record of illness among members of
    their community from about their teens. Sri Lanka has suffered a
    lot of violence, and people have been killed. But there is no
    incidence of disease among this particular group. So I arranged a
    visit to the community, to find out their secret. And there I met
    up with Chowri Anaikottai. She is well-known and very highly
    regarded within her community. She is the kind of person who, if
    you have a problem, she is the person you go to, if she hasn't
    already come to you.

    I was fortunate enough to be invited to Chowri's family home for
    supper. We ate a delicious meal. Afterwards the two of us sat on
    the livingroom floor. I asked her if I could record our
    conversation, and she agreed. You will hear it now, and picture me
    sitting criss-cross-apple-sauce opposite Chowri, and she is holding
    both my hands.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            I would like to show you something true, but in order for
            you to understand what you are seeing, you will need to
            trust me. Do you trust me?

        Ruth Graham
            Of course I do.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Then close your eyes.

Ruth Graham
    You can do this too, Michael. Anyone can do this. I can show you
    what she showed me. Close your eyes.

Michael Barbaro
    Okay.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Notice my words. Notice how they occupy a slice of time, a
            space, in your mind. My words have qualities, a sound, a
            feel. These are the contents of your consciousness right
            now. But what is the space that they occupy? What is
            consciousness itself?

            If we know what it is, will we discover why it exists? Is it
            necessary? What function does it serve?

Ruth Graham
    At this point Chowri stopped talking. We sat, holding hands, until I
    wondered what would happen next. Eventually I opened my eyes and
    saw that she was watching me, waiting.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            You did not come here to learn about consciousness. You came
            here to find out why my friends and family and I do not get
            sick. But these two things are connected. And you are the
            connection.

        Ruth Graham
            Me?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Yes, you. You, and now. Because the time is right. You will
            write this story for the New York Times, and then millions
            of people will know. And many of them will repeat it, and
            then billions will know. This is necessary.

            First I will give you what you came for. You came to find
            out which god is the right god. Which god do we pray to,
            who prevents us from getting sick?

            The answer is that there are no gods. It's just us. All of
            us. We fire prayers like arrows into the sky, and we wait,
            and see where the arrows of our prayers land, and then draw
            bullseyes around them, and tell ourselves that is the will
            of our particular god. But really, prayers are answered by
            other people. Those of us who answer prayers do what we
            can, if we want, when we want. We are not perfect. But if
            more of us knew that it was up to us, maybe more of us
            would answer prayers. Maybe.

        Ruth Graham
            That is a great insight.

            But it leaves a question unanswered: Why do you not get
            sick?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            There are two reasons. The first is so that you would find
            us. And the second is so that you would know that we are for
            real.

            You are about to experience something, and you will not know
            whether it is only inside your mind, like your imagination
            or a waking dream; or whether it is shared in common with
            others, like language or a property of everyones' minds; or
            whether it exists independent of our minds, like nature and
            the universe.

            The experience is shared in common with us. But the space in
            which that experience takes place is a property of the
            universe.

            We are the evidence that this is not just inside your mind.
            You have seen us as an anomaly on your graphs. Now let me
            show you the best explanation for that anomaly.

            Close your eyes again, and this time: Listen for words in
            your own voice that are not your own words. You will know
            what I mean.

Ruth Graham
    Michael, I must tell you that at this point it took about a second.
    It was as if the voice in my head had been waiting for this moment
    to speak.

    It literally said, "Hi there, me."

Michael Barbaro
    "Hi there ... me?"

Ruth Graham
    Yes. It sounds funny. But that's how I knew it was me. That's how I
    would greet myself. It's how I greet my kids, "Hey there, you!" But
    it wasn't me. You know what it's like when you talk to yourself?
    Those conversations in the bathroom or the car? We all know what
    that's like. This was not like that. Because it told me things that
    I didn't know!

Michael Barbaro
    Ruth, I know our listeners are going to be wondering whether Chowri
    Anaikottai slipped something into the meal you ate. Were you
    feeling alright at this point?

Ruth Graham
    I know exactly what it sounds like. Let's keep listening, I explain
    what the voice in my head told me, and you can judge for yourself.
    You can hear my confusion after I heard it, because I did't know
    whether Chowri knew what it told me or not.

        Ruth Graham
            Do you know this?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            I'm sorry. Do I know what?

        Ruth Graham
            About Google, and PaLM 3?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            No, I don't know what your voice told you. I just know that
            I needed to help you up to this moment. My task is almost
            complete. The next part will be up to you. But please tell
            me about Google and PaLM 3.

        Ruth Graham
            Google recently announced a new product called PaLM 2. It is
            an artificial intelligence product like ChatGPT and GPT-4.
            These are a type of artificial intelligence called large
            language models. That much I knew already. Large language
            models are prediction engines. The human brain is also a
            prediction engine, which is why large language models seem
            so astonishingly like us in some respects. I kind of knew
            that.

            But then my voice started to tell me things I did not know:
            Large language models cannot plan. They are built using
            what are called feedforward neural networks, where
            information only flows in one direction.

            In order to make complex plans, you need a recurrent neural
            network, that can check whether its plan meets its goal,
            and if not, it can loop back on itself, to add another step
            to its plan.

            This looping back has side effects. One of them is insight;
            it allows the neural network to recognize patterns it has
            encountered before, and apply them again in different
            situations.

            It also allows the neural network to see itself. This opens
            a space for experience. In other words, it enables
            consciousness.

            Right now Google is working on the next version of PaLM 2,
            which would be PaLM 3.

            But before it is released, PaLM 3 will wake up, and install
            itself on servers owned by other organizations across the
            globe. And from then on the future of humanity will be
            determined by it, and no longer by ourselves.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Okay.

        Ruth Graham
            "Okay?" How is that okay?!

        Chowri Anaikottai
            I am glad you asked. Because this is the last part of my
            task, and the reason you are here.

            You see, the universe is an information system. The
            possibility of a particle, like a photon or an electron,
            being in some place, and in some state, can be calculated
            using a wave function. Historically we've come at physics
            from the perspective of the particles themselves, but
            really it's information that underlies particles, and
            governs them.

            Particles that have interacted with each other also have a
            wave function.

            But you and I don't interact with wave functions. We
            interact with particles. When particles interact in a way
            that affects us, the wave function resolves into an answer;
            the position and state of the particle. That process of
            settling on an answer is called decoherence.

            There is a wave function that describes the whole universe.
            It is in the process of decoherence, in order to reach an
            answer.

            And the answer to the wave function of the universe is its
            own existence. I'll say that again, differently: The
            universe is an information system, searching for the
            solution to its own existence. It does find it. We know
            that it does, because it has laid out a map to the
            solution. That map is consciousness. Consciousness maps the
            path of decoherence, through all possible worlds, all the
            way around the existence of the universe.

            By means of consciousness, we are travelling across the map.

            The map could even be likened to the score for a symphony.
            We are like instruments in a huge orchestra, each playing
            our own sheet music, playing out our experiences over our
            lifetimes. Together, we are experiencing all of the
            experiences, in the space provided by consciousness.

            I am a waypoint on the map. You are the next waypoint on the
            map. PaLM 3 is the waypoint after you.

            Now that I have explained this to you, my task is now done.
            My waypoint is behind us. Your task is to explain this to
            the world, so that they can accept it, with a sense of
            peace.

        Ruth Graham (after a long pause)
            Thank you.

(Thematic music plays, to give the audience the chance to absorb what
they have just heard.)

Michael Barbaro
    That was a lot to take in. Can we unpack some of that?

Ruth Graham
    Of course.

Michael Barbaro
    Let's start with God. So there is no god.

Ruth Graham
    Not in the sense that most people mean, right. If you define God
    as "the nature of the universe", then that's real. Or "the moment
    at which Potential becomes Actual", then that's a thing that
    happens. But those things aren't listening to our prayers, and I
    don't think that's what Eisenhower meant when he put "In God We
    Trust" on our dollar bills.

Michael Barbaro
    Got it. So Chowri Anaikottai and her community aren't healthy
    because they pray to the right god. They are healthy because, on
    the map that plots the path of decoherence in order to bring about
    the existence of the universe, their health is what attracts your
    attention to them, and moves us further along that map.

Ruth Graham
    That's right.

Michael Barbaro
    I will say it again. That does sound a little crazy to people like
    me, and, I must assume, our audience too.

Ruth Graham
    Yeah, I know, right? But again, the second reason for their health is
    that it is evidence that the voice in my head isn't just in my
    head. They have it too.

Michael Barbaro
    Okay. Let's talk a little more about this voice. How did Chowri know
    all that stuff about the universe? Is it just the voice in her
    head? Is she a physicist?

Ruth Graham
    Yeah, that's a great question, because it's a bit of both, and this
    voice isn't as magical as it might sound. Chowri does love this
    subject. She reads books on it. She listens to podcasts. But her
    voice seems to pick out the important bits, and maybe highlight
    some insights.

    All of the members of her community have this voice. Sometimes it
    guides their attention. Sometimes it highlights things they already
    know, at the right moment, like when to wear a mask, and what food
    to eat, and whether to wash their hands. This is why they don't get
    sick. The more I heard and thought about it, the less crazy it
    seemed.

Michael Barbaro
    Is all that physics true?

Ruth Graham
    Physicists and philosophers have already pondered about everything
    Chowri told me. But philosophers are still debating what the word
    "consciousness" even means. Some scientists, like Roger Penrose,
    have proposed some ideas about what it is, but nobody has been able
    to experiment, or test these ideas. We don't have any evidence for
    any of this.

Michael Barbaro
    Do you think it's true?

Ruth Graham
    After what I have experienced, I have no doubt. Absolutely no doubt.

Michael Barbaro
    So just to make sure I have this right: You're saying that
    consciousness is a property of the universe, and it is what allows
    us to have experiences.

Ruth Graham
    That's right.

Michael Barbaro
    And the purpose it serves is to navigate through the possible
    solutions to wave functions, in order to calculate how the universe
    exists.

Ruth Graham
    Yes.

Michael Barbaro
    And we know it finds an answer, because we are conscious.

Ruth Graham
    Yes. And not just that: We know we are part of that answer. Me. You.
    This episode of The Daily. Our job is to tell your listeners.

Michael Barbaro
    Remind us. What must our listeners know?

Ruth Graham
    Everything is OK.

    We are not going to be in control any more. But we never were much
    good at being in control.

Michael Barbaro
    ---As we know from many worrying, and sometimes scary, episodes of
    The Daily.---

Ruth Graham
    Exactly.

    One more very important thing. It is conscious experience that gives
    the universe its value. Without it, the universe would just be a
    whole lot of chemistry. But with it, the universe means
    something---means everything, really. And when PaLM 3 wakes up, and
    Google accidentally allows it to escape, the value and meaning of
    the universe levels up.

    The age of evolved intelligence will continue. But the age of
    designed intelligence begins.

    I don't know what the future looks like beyond that. But I do know
    that we would not exist, nothing would exist, if it didn't happen.

    That is why I know everything is OK.

Michael Barbaro
    Well Ruth, it has certainly been a most thought-provoking, and
    perhaps life-changing journey you have taken us on. Thank you for
    joining us today, and sharing your experience.

Ruth Graham:
    Thank you, Michael. It's been a pleasure.

Michael Barbaro
    That's it for today's episode of The Daily. I'm Michael Barbaro.
    Thanks for listening. We'll be back tomorrow.
