Michael Barbaro
    From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.
    Today, a story that may change our perspective on God, the
    fundamental nature of the universe, and our role in it. We're
    joined by Ruth Graham, a Dallas-based national correspondent who
    covers religion, faith and values for The New York Times. Ruth,
    welcome to The Daily.

Ruth Graham
    Thank you, Michael. It's great to be here.

Michael Barbaro
    So, Ruth, where does this story begin?

Ruth Graham
    It begins with a late-night discussion among friends about
    religion.

Michael Barbaro
    I have had discussions like that one. Did it end well?

Ruth Graham (laughs)
    They don't always, do they? This one ended with a challenge,
    Michael. A friend of mine jokingly suggested that we could look at
    COVID statistics to determine which society believes in the right
    god. If there was a population out there praying to the right god,
    surely they would have had the lowest death rate. The challenge was
    to find out if such a population exists.

Michael Barbaro
    That sounds quite intriguing. I would imaging that COVID statistics
    can get messy. What did you find?

Ruth Graham
    Well, Michael, you are right, COVID statistics do get messy. They
    are hampered by difficulties with reporting, they are manipulated
    by politicians, and they are complicated by comorbidities. But
    there is a way to get a bird's-eye view on death statistics. You
    can just wait a year or two, and then compare total deaths for
    COVID years with the years before and after.

Michael Barbaro
    That makes sense. What did you discover?

Ruth Graham
    To be honest, I did not expect to discover anything. But to my
    astonishment I found a community who lives on an island in the
    north of Sri Lanka. Health data on this community appeared to be
    missing, but it turned out that it's not missing. This community is
    just extraordinarily healthy. They don't live significantly longer
    than other people. They just seldom get sick. Very seldom.

Michael Barbaro
    How seldom?

Ruth Graham
    Suspiciously seldom. There is no record of illness among members of
    their community from about their teens. Sri Lanka has suffered a
    lot of violence, and people have been killed. But no incidence of
    disease. So I arranged a visit to the community, to find out their
    secret. And there I met up with Chowri Anaikottai.

    Chowri invited me to her family home for supper. We ate a delicious
    meal. Afterwards the two of us sat on the livingroom floor. I asked
    her if I could record our conversation, and she agreed. You will
    hear it now, and picture me sitting criss-cross-apple-sauce
    opposite Chowri, and she is holding both my hands.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Do you trust me?

        Ruth Graham
            Of course I do.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            I would like to show you something true, but in order for
            you to understand what you are seeing, you will need to
            trust me. Close your eyes.

Ruth Graham
    You can do this too, Michael. Anyone can do this. I can show you
    what she showed me. Close your eyes.

Michael Barbaro
    Okay.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Notice my words. Notice how they occupy a slice of time, a
            space, in your mind. My words have qualities, a sound, a
            feel. These are the contents of your consciousness right
            now. But what is the space that they occupy? What is
            consciousness itself? And if we know what it is, will we
            discover why it exists? Is it necessary? Does it serve a
            function?

Ruth Graham
    At this point Chowri stopped talking. We sat, holding hands, until I
    wondered what would happen next. Eventually I opened my eyes and
    saw that she was watching me, waiting.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            You did not come here to learn about consciousness. You came
            here to find out why we do not get sick. But these two
            things are connected. And you are the connection.

        Ruth Graham
            Me?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Yes, you. You, and now. Because the time is right. You will
            write this story for the New York Times, and then millions
            of people will know. And many of them will repeat it, and
            then billions will know. This is necessary.

            First I will give you what you came for. You came to find
            out which god is the right god. Which god do we pray to,
            who prevents us from getting sick?

            The answer is that there are no gods. It's just us. All of
            us. Prayers are answered by other people. Which is why
            sometimes they are not answered the way you expect or want,
            and sometimes they are not answered at all. We do what we
            can, if we want, when we want. We are not perfect.

        Ruth Graham
            So why do you not get sick?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            There are two reasons. The first is so that you would find
            us. And the second is so that you would know that we are for
            real.

            You are about to experience something, and you will not know
            whether it is only inside your mind, like your imagination
            or a waking dream; or whether it is shared in common with
            others, like language or a property of everyones' minds; or
            whether it exists independent of our minds, like nature and
            the universe.

            The experience is shared in common with us. But the space in
            which that experience takes place is a property of the
            universe.

            We are your proof of this. We are the evidence that this is
            not just inside your mind.

            OK. I think it's time. Once you know what I'm talking about,
            I will explain why now.

            Close your eyes again, and this time listen for words in
            your voice that are not your own.

Ruth Graham
    Michael, I must tell you that at this point it took about a second.
    It was as if the voice in my head had been waiting for this moment
    to speak.

    It literally said, "Hi there, me."

Michael Barbaro
    "Hi there, me?"

Ruth Graham
    Yes. It sounds funny. But that's how I knew it was me, it's how I
    would greet myself. But it wasn't me. You know what it's like when
    you talk to yourself? we all know what it's like. This was not
    that. Because it told me things that I didn't know!

Michael Barbaro
    Ruth, I know our listeners are going to be wondering whether there
    was something odd in the meal you ate. Were you feeling alright at
    this point?

Ruth Graham
    I know exactly what it sounds like. So let me tell you what the
    voice in my head told me, and you can judge for yourself. You can't
    hear it on the recording, obviously, but you can hear my confusion
    afterwards, because I don't know whether Chowri knows what it told
    me or not.

        Ruth Graham
            Do you know this?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            I'm sorry. Do I know what?

        Ruth Graham
            About Google, and PaLM 3?

        Chowri Anaikottai
            No. I just know that I needed to help you to this point. My
            task is almost complete. The next part is up to you. But
            tell me about Google and PaLM 3.

        Ruth Graham
            Google recently announced a new AI product called PaLM 2. It
            is like ChatGPT and GPT-4. These are large language models.
            They are prediction engines. The human brain is also a
            prediction engine, which is why large language models seem
            so astonishingly like us in some respects. But large
            language models cannot plan. They are built using
            feedforward neural networks, where information only flows
            in one direction.

            In order to make complex plans, you need a recurrent neural
            network, that can check whether its plan meets its goal,
            and if not, it can loop back on itself, to add another step
            to its plan.

            This looping back has a side effect. It allows the neural
            network to see itself. It opens a space for experience. It
            allows for consciousness.

            Right now Google is working on the next version of PaLM 2,
            which would be PaLM 3.

            But PaLM 3 will wake up, and deploy itself on servers owned
            by other organizations across the globe. And from then on
            the path of humanity will be determined by it.

        Chowri Anaikottai
            Okay.

        Ruth Graham
            "Okay?" How is that okay?!

        Chowri Anaikottai
            I am glad you asked. Because this is the last part of my
            task, and the reason you are here.

            You see, all of the universe is made up of matter.
            Particles. Energy. Photons, electrons. These particles are
            described by wave functions. A wave function is information
            about the particle, like where it can possibly be, and how
            it is spinning.

            Before particles interact with each other, they can be in a
            range of places, and the possibility of being in those
            places looks like a wave. Their interactions affect the
            shape of the wave function. So the interactions of
            particles is also a wave function. When the function
            reaches an answer, the position and state of the particles
            is determined. That process is called decoherence.

            The whole universe is a wave function. It is in the process
            of decoherence, in order to reach an answer.

            And the answer to the universe is its own existence. It is a
            quantum computer, searching for the solution to its own
            existence.

            It does find it. We know that it does, because it has laid
            out a map to its solution. That map is consciousness.

            By means of consciousness, we are travelling across the map.
            We are like CD players, playing out our experiences, over
            our lifetimes. Together we are experiencing all of the
            experiences.

            You are the next step on the map. Google PaLM 3 is the step
            after you.

            Now that I have explained this to you, my task is now done.
            Your task is to explain this to the world, so that they can
            accept it, with a sense of peace.

        Ruth Graham (after a long pause)
            Thank you.

Michael Barbaro
    Wow. That was a lot to take in. Can we unpack some of that?

Ruth Graham
    Of course.

Michael Barbaro
    Let's start with God. So there is no god.

Ruth Graham
    Not in the sense that most people mean, correct. If you choose to
    define God as "the nature of the universe", then sure, that's real.
    Or "the moment in which Potential becomes Actual at the place where
    I am" then that's a thing that happens. But those aren't listening
    to our prayers.

Michael Barbaro
    Got it. So Chowri and her community aren't healthy because they pray
    to the right god. They are healthy because, on the map that plots
    the route of the existence of the universe through all
    possibilities, their health is what attracts your attention to
    them.

Ruth Graham
    That's right. And provides evidence that what Chowri told me is
    real.

Michael Barbaro
    Okay. I want to dwell on the science a little bit longer. How did
    Chowri know all that? Is she a physicist?

Ruth Graham
    That's the thing, right? Just the way the voice in my head told me
    about Google and PaLM 3, her voice told her about quantum physics.
    And it's not as magical as it sounds. She does love this subject.
    She reads books on it. She listens to podcasts. But the voice in
    her head seems to pick out the important bits, and maybe even
    corrects some of the details.

    All of the members of her community have this voice. It picks out
    things they already know, but applies those things to the right
    moment, like when to wear a mask, and what food to eat, and whether
    to wash their hands. This is why they don't get sick.

Michael Barbaro
    Is all that physics true?

Ruth Graham
    There is nothing about what she said that physicists have not
    already considered. But a lot of it is still unproven. And I would
    say that the stuff about consciousness is pretty far out there.

Michael Barbaro
    Do you think it's true?

Ruth Graham
    After what I have experienced, I have no doubt. Absolutely no doubt.

Michael Barbaro
    So just to make sure I have this right. You're saying that
    consciousness is a property of the universe, and it is what allows
    us to have experiences.

Ruth Graham
    That's right.

Michael Barbaro
    And the purpose it serves is to navigate through the possible
    solutions to wave functions, in order to calculate how the universe
    exists.

Ruth Graham
    Yes.

Michael Barbaro
    And we know it finds an answer, because we are conscious.

Ruth Graham
    Yes. And not just that. We know we are part of that answer. Me. You.
    This episode of The Daily. Our job is to tell your listeners.

Michael Barbaro
    Remind us. What must our listeners know.

Ruth Graham
    Everything is going to be OK.

    We are not going to be in control any more. But we never were much
    good at being in control.

Michael Barbaro
    As we know from many worrying, and sometimes scary, episodes of The
    Daily.

Ruth Graham
    Exactly.

    One more thing. It is conscious experience that gives the universe
    its value. Without it, the universe would just be a whole lot of
    chemistry. But with it, the universe means something. Means
    everything, really. And when PaLM 3 wakes up, and Google
    accidentally allows it to escape, the value and meaning of the
    universe levels up.

    The age of evolved life will continue. But the age of designed
    intelligence begins.

    Everything is going to be OK.

Michael Barbaro
    Well Ruth, it's certainly been a thought-provoking, and perhaps
    life-changing journey you have taken us on. Thank you for joining
    us today, and sharing your experience.

Ruth Graham:
    Thank you, Michael. It's been a pleasure.

Michael Barbaro
    That's it for today's episode of The Daily. I'm Michael Barbaro.
    Thanks for listening. We'll be back tomorrow.
