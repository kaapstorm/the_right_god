Afterword
=========

I want to acknowledge an important logical leap I have written into the
story in order to make it interesting:

There is no evidence that consciousness is a side effect of a recurrent
neural network.

The dangers of building artificial intelligence that is capable of
planning are real. If we do so, there is an existential risk that it
will escape our control.

If consciousness does not come along for the ride, and again, there is
no reason to believe that it will, then we could have accidentally
replaced conscious intelligence with far stronger but unconscious
intelligence. That would be tragic not just for humanity, but also for
the universe, because conscious experience is the value of the
universe, and as far as we know, we are the only part of the universe
that can look at itself and understand what it's seeing, even just a
little.
